# SinglePortfolio

A portfolio website displaying galleries of images for a single person. There are a few reasons for this project:

* Learn how to use Angular
* Use Node.js in a production environment
* Take advantage of free server hosting via AWS

This project is mainly being build for a friend who wanted to have a proper portfolio site. This is mainly an excuse for me to try using these tecnologies, since it allows me to have a product to work towards.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.
