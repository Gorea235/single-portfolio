# SinglePortfolio

A portfolio website displaying galleries of images for a single person. The main page shows the list of galleries in the centre, with random images scrolling along the edge to provide samples of the portfolio. The gallery pages show some information about the gallery and all the images in it.

The site also provides an admin section that can be used to edit all the galleries and general config.

## Development
I'm making this mostly to learn a few new technologies, namely Angular 5 and Node.js. The basis of the project is a portfolio site for a friend.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.
